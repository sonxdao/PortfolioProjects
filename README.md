This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects that I create!

As a chocolate fanatic, I have always wondered what makes up a chocolate bar! That satisfaction I get from each bite makes me wonder what is in it, how is it made, what is the cocoa percentage, and how expert chocolate raters/tasters would rate it. Do I have the same palletes as the professionals? It gets more interesting as I keep pondering. I am aspired by this foodie idea, and I decided to do a project while I am at it. 

The data set Chocolate Bar Ratings that I found on Kaggle is ideal for this case study. It contains expert ratings of over 17,00 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used and where the beans were grown. The sample size should be big enough for to reflect my tastebuds' accuracy.
